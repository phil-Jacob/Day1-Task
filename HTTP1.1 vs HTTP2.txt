Introduction :
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of communication on the World Wide Web.
IT was developed to enhance the performance and efficiency of web browsing. 
Two significant versions are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. 
In this blog post, we will explore the differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

HTTP/1.1:
HTTP/1.1 was released in 1999.
It functions on a request-response model, where a client sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested resource. 
HTTP/1.1 has some limitations that hindered its performance,such as
1.It relies on single connnection per request. hence if a resource is requested but delayed due to, a large image or slow server response, 
subsequent requests must wait, slowing down the overall page load time.
2. It does not natively support compression of headers, which can result in increased bandwidth usage.
3. Since it works on a request-response model,the server cannot proactively send additional resources to the client before they are requested.

HTTP/2 :
1.HTTP/2 was introduced in 2015 as an improved version of HTTP,
designed to address the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and enhance web performance.
2.Most significant improvements in HTTP/2 is the introduction of multiplexing.
It allows multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently over a single TCP connection,
eliminating head-of-line blocking and reducing latency. This results in faster and more efficient page loading.
3.It uses a binary format instead of plain text, which reduces overhead and makes parsing more efficient.
4. HTTP/2 introduces server push, allowing the server to proactively send additional resources to the client before they are requested.
